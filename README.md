# Note Taker

Note Taker is an application that allows you to write and save notes. It provides a user-friendly interface for organizing your thoughts and keeping track of tasks you need to complete. The application uses an Express.js back end to store and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story

As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I open the Note Taker, I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
- When I click on the link to the notes page, I am presented with a page that displays existing notes in the left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
- When I enter a new note title and text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
- When I click on the Save icon, the new note I entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
- When I click on an existing note in the list, that note appears in the right-hand column.
- When I click on the Write icon in the navigation, I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
